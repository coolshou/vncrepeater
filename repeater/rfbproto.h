/*
 * rfbproto.h - header file for the RFB protocol version 3.3
 *
 * Uses types CARD<n> for an n-bit unsigned integer, INT<n> for an n-bit signed
 * integer (for n = 8, 16 and 32).
 *
 * All multiple byte integers are in big endian (network) order (most
 * significant byte first).  Unless noted otherwise there is no special
 * alignment of protocol structures.
 *
 *
 * Once the initial handshaking is done, all messages start with a type byte,
 * (usually) followed by message-specific data.  The order of definitions in
 * this file is as follows:
 *
 *  (1) Structures used in several types of message.
 *  (2) Structures used in the initial handshaking.
 *  (3) Message types.
 *  (4) Encoding types.
 *  (5) For each message type, the form of the data following the type byte.
 *      Sometimes this is defined by a single structure but the more complex
 *      messages have to be explained by comments.
 */

/*****************************************************************************
 *
 * Initial handshaking messages
 *
 *****************************************************************************/

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Protocol Version
 *
 * The server always sends 12 bytes to start which identifies the latest RFB
 * protocol version number which it supports.  These bytes are interpreted
 * as a string of 12 ASCII characters in the format "RFB xxx.yyy\n" where
 * xxx and yyy are the major and minor version numbers (for version 3.3
 * this is "RFB 003.003\n").
 *
 * The client then replies with a similar 12-byte message giving the version
 * number of the protocol which should actually be used (which may be different
 * to that quoted by the server).
 *
 * It is intended that both clients and servers may provide some level of
 * backwards compatibility by this mechanism.  Servers in particular should
 * attempt to provide backwards compatibility, and even forwards compatibility
 * to some extent.  For example if a client demands version 3.1 of the
 * protocol, a 3.0 server can probably assume that by ignoring requests for
 * encoding types it doesn't understand, everything will still work OK.  This
 * will probably not be the case for changes in the major version number.
 *
 * The format string below can be used in sprintf or sscanf to generate or
 * decode the version string respectively.

 * Authentication
 *
 * Once the protocol version has been decided, the server then sends a 32-bit
 * word indicating whether any authentication is needed on the connection.
 * The value of this word determines the authentication scheme in use.  For
 * version 3.0 of the protocol this may have one of the following values:

/*
 * rfbConnFailed:	For some reason the connection failed (e.g. the server
 *			cannot support the desired protocol version).  This is
 *			followed by a string describing the reason (where a
 *			string is specified as a 32-bit length followed by that
 *			many ASCII characters).
 *
 * rfbNoAuth:		No authentication is needed.
 *
 * rfbVncAuth:		The VNC authentication scheme is to be used.  A 16-byte
 *			challenge follows, which the client encrypts as
 *			appropriate using the password and sends the resulting
 *			16-byte response.  If the response is correct, the
 *			server sends the 32-bit word rfbVncAuthOK.  If a simple
 *			failure happens, the server sends rfbVncAuthFailed and
 *			closes the connection. If the server decides that too
 *			many failures have occurred, it sends rfbVncAuthTooMany
 *			and closes the connection.  In the latter case, the
 *			server should not allow an immediate reconnection by
 *			the client.
